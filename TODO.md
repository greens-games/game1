- Finish open getting started (Camera pitch + yaw) + mouse movement -- DONE
- play around with different camera stuff
- get a 2D camera going
- keep playing around with transforms, view, and camera values

DO ALL THE ABOVE BEFORE STARTING GAME STUFF AND MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE GRAPHICS STUFF GOING ON

- Clean up code abit (get rid of commented out bits, get useful reusable stuff separated out appropriately)
